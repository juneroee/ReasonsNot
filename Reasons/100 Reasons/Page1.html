        <div class="reason" id="reason1" align="center">
            <h1>1. <br> You are important.</h1>
             <p>
                YOU are important! You have a unique purpose, that only you can fulfill. This post serves a gentle reminder that YOU matter! Don’t ever question that one tiny fact, YOU are very important!
             </p>
            
        </div>

        <div class="reason" id="reason2" align="center">
            <h1>2.<br> You are not worthless.</h1>
             <p>
                Why do you feel the need to believe your own lies? You need to believe that you are worth it and you need to believe that you will get through this.
             </p>
        </div>

        <div class="reason" id="reason3" align="center">
            <h1>3.<br> You matter.</h1>
             <p>
                You matter because you are the only person who can be you. This planet has over 7 billion people and yet you are the only person who is exactly like you. Take for instance, your fingerprints; you are the only one with them.
             </p>
        </div>

        <div class="reason" id="reason4" align="center">
            <h1>4.<br> You are NEVER alone.</h1>
             <p>
                You are never alone because there are people who think and feel the same way as you do.
             </p>
        </div>

        <div class="reason" id="reason5" align="center">
            <h1>5. <br> Nobody else can be you.</h1>
             <p>
                To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment
             </p>
        </div>

        <div class="reason" id="reason6" align="center">
            <h1>6. <br> You have potential.</h1>
             <p>
                There is no man living who isn’t capable of doing more than he thinks he can do.
             </p>
        </div>

        <div class="reason" id="reason7" align="center">
            <h1>7. <br> Better days are coming.</h1>
             <p>
               It's important to be able to distinguish between what happens to us and who we are, and look forward with hope for new and better days ahead!

        </div>

        <div class="reason" id="reason8" align="center">
            <h1>8. <br> Your loved ones will never get over it.</h1>
             <p>
               They will learn to live with it. they will heal and they will rebuild theirself around the loss they have suffered. They will be whole again but they will never be the same.
             </p>
        </div>

        <div class="reason" id="reason9" align="center">
            <h1>9. <br> It will leave unanswered questions.</h1>
             <p>
                Suicide does that. It brings sorrow and raises questions that linger. It begs for answers that rarely come.
             </p>
        </div>

        <div class="reason" id="reason10" align="center">
