            <h1>41. <br> Someone wants to listen to you.</h1>
             <p>
                Sometimes all you need is someone who is willing to listen to you.

            <h1>44.<br> The Museum.</h1>
             <p>
                A visit to a museum is a search for beauty, truth, and meaning in our lives. Go to museums as often as you can.

        </div>

        <div class="reason" id="reason5" align="center">
            <h1>45. <br>You can end toxic relationships.</h1>
             <p>
                A bad relationship is like standing on broken glass, if you stay you will keep hurting. If you walk away, you will hurt but eventually, you will heal.

             <p>
                It is not always possible to do away with negative thinking, but with persistence and practice, one can gain mastery over them so that they do not take the upper hand.

             <p>
                It’s not true that money can’t buy happiness. I mean, have you tried buying ice cream? It’s the same thing!

            <h1>49. <br>Dogs.</h1>
