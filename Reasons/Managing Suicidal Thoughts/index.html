            <h1>Think of Reasons for Living</h1>
            <p> Most people who think about suicide want to escape their pain, but they do not always want to die. When you feel low, it’s easy to stay focused on things that are negative and upsetting in your life. This makes it easy to think of suicide as the only option. Start thinking about some reasons you have for living. For example, many people have relationships with loved ones, pets they love, religion, goals, and dreams, or responsibilities to others in their life that give them reasons to live and prevent them from acting on their suicidal thoughts. Think of all of the reasons you have for living. Write them down. Remind yourself of them when you are feeling low.</p>

            <h1>Stay Connected</h1>
            <p>It is important to speak to someone you trust about how you feel. Sometimes just talking about how you feel can help. People often say they are relieved that they shared how they felt with someone. Talking can help you feel less alone. Feelings of guilt or a sense of being a burden can lead you to avoid loved ones, but staying in touch with the people who care about you can make it easier to navigate a mental health crisis. Try reaching out to someone you trust by saying, “I’m having a hard time. Can you keep me company?”</p>

            <h1>Try to solve your problem</h1>
            <p>It is always helpful to think of ways other than suicide that you can solve your problems. First, make a list of all the problems you are dealing within your life. Second, make a list of all the solutions you can think of for those problems. You can ask someone you trust to help you with this. Dealing with 1 or 2 small problems can help to put an end to immediate feelings of suicide. Once you are thinking more clearly, you can tackle other bigger problems.</p>

            <h1>Find positive distractions</h1>
            <p>Activities you enjoy could help ease dark or painful thoughts and even rekindle some feelings of joy by helping you remember a few reasons to keep living. Reading a good book might remind you how excited you are for the next volume in the series, while taking your dog for a good long jog might remind you of their unconditional affection and companionship. </p>
