                <h1>Do things you enjoy</h1>
                <p>When you are feeling very low, do an activity you enjoy. You may find that very few things bring you pleasure. Think of things you used to enjoy doing at times you didn’t feel so depressed or suicidal. Do these things, even if they don’t bring you enjoyment right now. Giving yourself a break from suicidal thoughts can help, even if it’s for a short time.</p>

                <h1>Think of personal goals</h1>
                <p>Think of personal goals you have for yourself, or that you’ve had in the past. Some examples are: to read a particular book; travel; get a pet; move to another place; learn a new hobby; volunteer; go back to school; or start a family.</p>

                <h1>Self-care</h1>
                <p>Taking good care of yourself is important to feel better. It is important to do the following:
                    eat a healthy diet,
                    get some exercise every day,
                    get a good night’s sleep,
                    decrease or stop using alcohol or drugs, as these can make feelings of depression and suicide worse</p>

                <h1>Get treatment</h1>
                <p> It is important to get treatment for depression, anxiety, and alcohol and drug problems. Just seeing your family doctor may not be enough. It can help to see a mental health specialist, such as a psychologist or a psychiatrist. If you are already receiving treatment, speak up if your treatment plan is not working.</p>

                <h1>Know the Warning Signs</h1>
                <p>The best way to prevent suicide is to recognize these warning signs and know how to respond if you spot them. If you believe that a friend or family member is suicidal, you can play a role in suicide prevention by pointing out the alternatives, showing that you care, and getting a doctor or psychologist involved.</p>

                <h1>Structure and routine</h1>
                <p>Keep a regular routine as much as possible, even when your feelings seem out of control. Here are some tips for creating structure in your life:
                    wake up at a regular time,
                    have a regular bedtime,
                    have planned activities in your day - such as going for a walk or going to the gym,
                    continue to go to work or school.</p>
